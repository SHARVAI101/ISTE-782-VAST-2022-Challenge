# Visualizing Urban Dynamics: Unveiling Patterns and Opportunities for Urban Planning in Ohio
By Harshitha and Sharvai


The challenge describes the fictional town of Engagement in Ohio, which is preparing for rapid growth in the future. To assess what measures need to be taken in order to be better prepared, the city has started an urban planning exercise in which people from the city can volunteer to participate.
The goal of the study is to understand the current situation of the city and identify areas where development can be done. To this end, the city has built an app that collects data from about 1000 users and creates logs of their daily activities. This data is then used to create visualizations to help determine where improvements can be made.
